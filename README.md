# Hack-Computer
 Build your own computer from scratch! The Hack computer project lets you design and test a 16-bit computer architecture,  starting with fundamental NAND gates and working your way up through a hardware simulator.  This step-by-step approach culminates in a functional machine capable of running Tetris.

# Motive Of Project:
The Hack CPU is the heart of the Hack computer project, a simplified 16-bit CPU you build yourself.  This educational journey starts with fundamental logic gates and progresses through a hardware simulator to create the core components like the ALU and memory, ultimately resulting in a CPU capable of executing instructions.

## Steps to be followed:
Step 1
Understand the logic circuit of the CPU
Step 2
Build the basic chips in the CPU using NAND gates
Step 3
After building we have to make use of all these in a single HDL file name CPU
Step 4
By seeing the connectivity from the logic circuit diagram, we will make the HDL file.
Step 5
After saving the HDL file we will load this chip into the simulator and test it with various examples.
Step 6
After building the CPU we will build RAM and ROM HDL files.
Step 7
Now we will combine CPU, RAM, ROM into a single HDL file named Computer.
Step 8
After saving the HDL file we will load it into the hardware simulator and test it with various hack file programs
