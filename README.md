# Hack-Computer
 Build your own computer from scratch! The Hack computer project lets you design and test a 16-bit computer architecture,  starting with fundamental NAND gates and working your way up through a hardware simulator.  This step-by-step approach culminates in a functional machine capable of running Tetris.

# Motive Of Project:
The Hack CPU is the heart of the Hack computer project, a simplified 16-bit CPU you build yourself.  This educational journey starts with fundamental logic gates and progresses through a hardware simulator to create the core components like the ALU and memory, ultimately resulting in a CPU capable of executing instructions.
